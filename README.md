# Rec Room CV2 Keyboard

This is a keyboard that I designed to work in Rec Room that can interface with your real life computer. It works by converting the button pressed into [Hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) data, which is read by a Python Script to conver it back into the ASCII character.
